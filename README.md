ðŸ“· Camera Calibration Using DLT and Levenbergâ€“Marquardt Optimization
This project implements a two-step camera calibration pipeline that estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a camera using:

Direct Linear Transform (DLT) â€” a linear method to estimate the projection matrix.

Levenbergâ€“Marquardt Optimization â€” a non-linear refinement method to minimize reprojection error.

Overview
Accurate camera calibration is essential for 3D reconstruction, augmented reality, and robotics. While DLT offers a fast closed-form solution, it is sensitive to noise and does not minimize geometric error. This implementation improves DLT with a second-stage optimization using the Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm.

Features
Synthetic 3D-to-2D point generation with Gaussian noise.

Matrix construction for DLT using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).

Reprojection error calculation.

Refinement via non-linear least squares using scipy.optimize.least_squares.

Visualization of before and after optimization projections.

Quantitative error comparison.
